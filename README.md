# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using CNN  

## 📝 Overview  
This project is designed to identify diseases in plant leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By analyzing images of leaves, the model detects and classifies diseases, helping farmers and gardeners maintain healthy plants.  

The project includes a *Streamlit Web Application* where users can upload images of leaves to get real-time disease detection results.  

## 🌟 Features  
- *Real-time Disease Detection*: Upload a leaf image to detect potential diseases.  
- *Multi-class Classification*: Detects several common leaf diseases and healthy leaves.  
- *Streamlit Interface*: Intuitive web app for seamless user interaction.  

## 🚀 Supported Diseases  
1. *Healthy Leaves* 🌱  
2. *Powdery Mildew* 🌾  
3. *Leaf Spot* 🍂  
4. *Rust* 🍁  

## 🛠 Requirements  
To run the project, you need the following:  
- Python 3.7+  
- TensorFlow/Keras for the CNN model  
- Streamlit for the web application  

Install the dependencies using:  
bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
  

## 🏃‍♂ Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the repository:  
bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaf-disease-detection.git  
  

### 2. Install dependencies:  
bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
  

### 3. Run the Streamlit app:  
bash  
streamlit run app.py  
  

### 4. Upload images:  
Upload an image of a leaf through the app to get predictions about its health or disease.  

## 💡 How It Works  
- *CNN Model*: The model is trained on a dataset of leaf images, labeled for various diseases and healthy leaves.  
- *Detection*: Once an image is uploaded, the CNN analyzes it to classify the leaf condition.  
- *Streamlit Interface*: A simple platform to visualize predictions and confidence scores.  

## 📊 Results  
The app highlights the detected disease with a confidence score, helping users make informed decisions about plant care.
